walk from fashionable Kolonaki with its boutiques and famous cafes and restaurants as well as all the major
cultural points such as museums,galleries, theaters, the hotel is the ideal base from which to visit the key attractions of this beautiful
historic city.</p>


            <p>The hotel is a magnificent venue for meetings, business conferences and special events. The 4.000m2 allocated to 16 beautifully appointed meeting rooms are much more than aesthetically pleasing, since they
also possess hi-tech features and amenities specially designed to boast your business. Unique as it may be the setting would be nothing without our experienced and well trained personnel that
bring it to life. The loyalty of our guests is legendary and this has mainly to do with the fact that they can find the same dedicated and attentive service on every visit.
Greek cuisine needs no introduction. Among the pleasures of a trip in Athens, a city famous for its art, culture and fashion, eating well has always been one of the greatest enjoyments. The hotel offers 3 restaurants each
with its own personality. One should not miss the experience at Brown’s Restaurant with its elegant colors, crystal chandeliers and leather settings. Don’t miss to taste our exceptional, contemporary Mediterranean
cuisine with stunning creations always prepared with imagination, flair and attention to detail.</p>

Decorated in relaxing colors with peaceful music and scented candles, one can find three private treatment rooms, including one room specially
designed for two. Treatments are tailored to your personal needs, ensuring an experience of the highest quality. For this reason we have chosen two
of the best in the sector, Ligne St. Barth and Thalgo with products of outstanding quality, ultra professional protocols and exceptional diversity.
Furthermore the Peak Health Club & SPA offers a state of the art fitness centre with the latest Technogym cardiovascular equipment. But this is
not even half of it! The fitness center boasts fantastic views of the city, to make one’s workout more enjoyable and to take his mind of the task at
