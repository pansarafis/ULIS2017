            <h3>Abstract Submission</h3>
            <p>Original 2-page abstracts with illustrations will be accepted for review in pdf format. Papers submitted for review will clearly state:
            <ul>
                <li>The purpose of the work</li>
                <li>How and to what extent it advances the art</li>
                <li>Specific new results and their impact</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The degree to which the paper deals with these issues will affect the paper selection. The most frequent cause of rejection of submitted papers is a lack of new results. 
Only work that has not been previously published at the time of the Conference will be considered. Submission of a paper for review and subsequent acceptance is considered by the Committee as an agreement that the work will not be placed in the public domain prior to the Conference.</p>
