            <h2>Scope of the Conference </h2>
            <p>The third joint EUROSOI-ULIS event will be hosted by the Institute of Nanoscience & Nanotechnology of NCSR “Demokritos” in Athens, Greece. The focus of the sessions is on SOI technology and advanced nanoscale devices.</p>

            <h2>Call for Papers</h2> 
            <p>The organizing committee invites scientists and engineers working in the above fields to actively participate by submitting high quality papers. Original 2-page abstracts with illustrations will be accepted for review in pdf format. The accepted abstracts will be published in a Proceedings book with an ISBN. 
A 4-page follow-up paper delivered before April 3, 2016 will be published in IEEE Xplore Digital Library. The authors of the best papers will be invited to submit a longer version for publication in a special issue of Solid-State Electronics. A best paper award will be attributed to the best paper by the  SINANO institute.
