            <h2>ULIS Best Paper Award</h2>
            A Sinano Best Paper Award (joint Sinano/Ulis) has been proposed in the framework of the European EuroSOI - ULIS Conference: The Sinano Institute will sponsor the EuroSOI - ULIS 2017 Conference, which is in the same research area as the research domains of the Sinano Institute.
            <ul>
                <li>A medal (Sinano Institute/ULIS logos) will be given every year to the best ULIS paper (first medal given during 2011 for the papers presented at ULIS 2010)</li>
                <li>An award of 300â‚¬ will be given to the first author of the best paper</li>
                <li>A USB stick including the ULIS Proceedings (with the Sinano Institute logo) will also be given to ULIS participant  </li>
            </ul>
