            <h2>About Athens</h2>
                          
            <p>Athens  is the capital and largest city of Greece. Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, 
                with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years.</p>          
           
            <p>Classical Athens was a powerful city-state that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port of Piraeus.
                A centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, 
                home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum,
                it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, 
                largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent, and in particular the Romans.</p>    
         
            <p>In modern times, Athens is a large cosmopolitan metropolis and central to economic, financial, industrial, maritime, 
                political and cultural life in Greece.
                Athens is recognised as a global city because of its location and its importance in shipping, finance, commerce, media, 
                entertainment, arts, international trade, culture, education and tourism. It is one of the biggest economic centres
                in southeastern Europe,  with a large financial sector, 
                and its port Piraeus is the largest passenger port in Europe and the second largest in the world.
